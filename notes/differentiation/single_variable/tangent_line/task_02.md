Find the coordinates on the curve y = 8 - 16/x where gradient of the tangent is 4.

the gradient of the tangent is the same as the slope at a given point. it's also the same as the derivative at that point. so, let's take the derivative:

$$ y(x) = 8 - \frac{16}{x} = 8 - 16x^{-1}$$

$$y'(x) = 0 - 16(-1)x^{-2} = \frac{16}{x^2}$$

so, where does y'(x) = 4?

$$y'(x) = 4 = \frac{16}{x^2}$$

$$4x^2 = 16$$

$$x^2 = 4$$

$$x = \{-2, 2\}$$

you've got the x values right! now we just need to know what the y values are at those points on the curve.

$$y(-2) = 8 - 16/(-2) = 8 + 8 = 16$$

$$y(2) = 8 - 16/(2) = 8 - 8 = 0$$
